Additions:
Used Inquirer prompt instead of process.argv commands to ensure there are not syntax errors....also its alot faster then typing out the full command each time.  Also, wanted to increase the user expereince a bit so I switched the commands to the following:

concert-this ==> Find a band's upcoming shows
spotify-this-song  ==>  Find a song's details
movie-this / Find  ==>  movie's details
do-what-it-says  ==>  Find out something new
